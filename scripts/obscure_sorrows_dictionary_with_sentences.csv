Midsummer,"point in your mid-twenties when your youthfulness expires as a valid excuse, leaving you accountable for your own station in life, even if you're still only reeling from your past or planning for the future— which somehow makes time itself feel more urgent than before, until even the springtime pollen floating in the air reminds you of the coming snow.",n.,"Borrowed from the traditional feast of the summer solstice, after which all the days become shorter.",Boats Against the Current,Kenopsia,Time-Memory; Beginnings-Endings; Identity-Personality,"I hit my midsummer right around 26, when hangovers got worse and figuring it out"" stopped sounding cute; She keeps joking that her midsummer arrived the day she realized she relates more to the parents than the teens in movies; It feels like you're going through your own midsummer right now"

Agnosthesia,"state of not knowing how you really feel about something, which forces you to sift through clues hidden in your own behavior, as if you were some other person—noticing a twist of acid in your voice, an obscene amount of effort you put into something trifling, or an inexplicable weight on your shoulders that makes it difficult to get out of bed.",n.,"Ancient Greek ἄγνωστος (ágnōstos), not knowing + διάθεσις (diáthesis), condition, mood.
